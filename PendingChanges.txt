COMPLETE * Add Error code blocks to populate Error Status Indicator on Front Panel
COMPLETE * Populate error code array and disperse to various exception blocks
COMPLETE * Reimplement linux variant with the aforementioned updates.
	Linux Variant Requires:
		self.basedir = os.path.expanduser('~/CVI/')	 #Full path required; however, os.path.expanduser will allow use of ~
COMPLETE * Change Defaults file for linux path '~/CVI/'
COMPLETE * Rectify Issue with counterflow reduction overshooting.
COMPLETE * Provide error instructions for if any files are not found.
COMPLETE * Identify issue with segmentation faults occuring in linux and NOT windows
	COMPLETE * Correct Linux thread.join() issue. Currently disabled which can cause problems in future
COMPLETE * Add DSM header box on calibrations panel
COMPLETE * Add calibration coefficient version dropdown

COMPLETE * Add rolling save files for main status and error status indicators
COMPLETE * Correct calibration saving routine such that it will actually update
UNECESSARY * Allow realtime updating for reading calibration coefficients from tables
COMPLETE * Add delete button for deleting certain coefficients
COMPLETE * Add update button to reread calibrations from files
COMPLETE * Add ability to prevent rapid updates to text entry fields so that a . is not read, etc. (check if field is being entered?)
COMPLETE * Remove DSM Header printout to terminal
UNECESSARY * Add wrap text and scrollable to dsm header box.
* Verify why flow can be "off" and yet the user input voltages will still output.
COMPLETE * Correct raw input/output indicator updating (and labeling)
COMPLETE * Correct Display scaling for program
COMPLETE * Verify that when instrument add routine is cancelled, valves are reverted and things are reversed.
COMPLETE * Add sliders to everything!!!
* Add counterflow excess increase button for just in case moments
* Allow cvfx0, cvfx2, cvfx3, cvfx4 to independently increased while allowing other flows to compensate.
	cvfx0 would compensate for any changes to the other ones (autopilot button?)
COMPLETE * Grey out the connect and disconnect buttons after the connect button is pressed.
COMPLETE * Add checklist that pops up upon request that allows you to set a data folder prefix for flight, etc.
COMPLETE * Add dropdown list for common notes to be added to the log

* Add notes for when toggles are changed
PARTIAL * CLEAN UP AND COMMENT CODE
PARTIAL * Check to make sure nothing references text fields
	* Instrument configurations still reference fields, replace areas with exception handling
* Continue updates to error log and main log
* Use findChild method for most objects and then remove repetitive objects
* Determine whether or not flows or manual voltage controls need to have negative values

COMPLETE * Correct NIDAS header output....
* Correct text entry fields (manVolt) to be editingFinished...


Miscellaneous Updates
* Added exception handling for full feedback loop. Try to perform calculation, exception prints out raw data stream to terminal.


Error Events:

CHECKLIST
	Preflight check:
		List of preflight things that should have been completed (checkboxes for each?)
			Probe Cover Off
			Add butanol if needed -- 50 mls (2/3" height in fill bottle) for 25 hours
			Power strip switch ON, UHSAS switch ON, Top Box Power Switch ON, TDL switch ON
			CVI Laptop ON, WIBS laptop ON.
			Set up T Controller: CTR1(release)/RUN(release), CTR2/RUN, CTR3/RUN (CTR4 not needed).
				To change setpoint 1, CTR1/STOP, CTR1(hold)/SETPT(release). Enter setpoint with right key,
				left key to exit (if passcode is needed, it's 3254)
			Open main valve on one zero air cylinder and toggle valve downstream, check gauge P at ~20 psi
			When Laptop boots:
				Login as CVI-OPS without password (FYI--Admin password is "cvi") & check time
				Start UHSAS vi. Then: Laser Control: Temp & Current On, Histogram Tab: Run
				Double click on CVI_IDEAS2013 icon to start labview VI (program)
			On open vi, click Run arrow. Click big black flow button (to ON). Check DSM data coming on TEST tables
			Press CONNECT (left side of screen): & follow prompts for WIBS connect, ignoring valve changes
			Pump switch ON (main box) to test system flows & that particles and water vapor are ~0
			VNC to WIBS computer, follow WIBS checklist, minimize VNC ("dms-sw-loaner" is name)
			On Top box: Pump switch OFF
			On main vi, click big Flow button (to OFF), & yellow STOP button
			(if you have time) Open Date/Time windows on both laptops to make sure they sync
			Open xchat, join #GV
	BEFORE TAKEOFF
		Start UHSAS recording and give data file name: Record (enter file name)
		On open main vi, click Run arrow. Big black Flow button (to On). Check DSM data coming on TEST tables
		Press CONNECT (left side of screen): & follow prompts for WIBS connect, ignoring valve changes
		Pump switch ON (main box)
		Main heater switch ON box (No shroud, so "Shroud Heater" switch stays OFF)
		Through VNC, check that WIBS is still running
		Record Labview data file name (*.*q) at bottom of screen
	DURING FLIGHT
		Monitor variables. Monitor Zero Air & switch cylinders if nec. by closing one and rapidly opening other.
		Take ambient sample as needed for WIBS & filters (saves air but don't overdo)
			Change "CVI" switch up to "TOTAL" (front panel, upper left)
			After sample, change "TOTAL" down to "CVI" (Return to CVI mode for landing)
		If RHOOTDL > ~0.4 g/m^3), increase FX0C & FX2C from 2.0 to ~ 6.0 clpm or higher (5 slpm is max).
			Return flows to normal 2.0 when out of cloud
		To sample on filter in cloud (set up prior to cloud pass)
		Begin Sampling:
			Press CONNECT button on CVI display front panel. Ignore steps for Users.
			Open 2 green impactor valves and close blue on in center.
			Press large CVI button on right of windows that opens
			Push large USER button on 2nd window.
			Record sample start time, alt, etc. in lab book chart
		After Sampling:
			Press disconnect button on front panel	
			Open blue vale in center and close 2 green impactor valves
			Press large USER button on right of window that opens
			Push large CVI button on 2nd window
			Record sample end time, alt, etc. on chart.
	AFTER LANDING
		Main heaters OFF (Can do on descent if cloud-free)
		Pump Switch OFF
		Laptop:
			Click big red Flow button (to OFF)
			Click big yellow STOP toggle switch (updates stop)
			File-Exit Program
		UHSAS: Stop button in program
		TDL and Main box Power switch OFF, UHSAS OFF, rear power strip OFF
		Thru VNC, run WIBS in Forced Trigger mode 3 minutes, then File-Exit
		If time, download CVI "q" file & WIBS data files to memory stick
		Shutdown CVI & WIBS laptops
		Zero Air Valves closed, record pressure and replace zero air if necessary (uses ~200 psi/hour)
		Check Probe Cover on
		
		
THINGS TO DO WITH A PREFLIGHT BUTTON
	Request what prefix to give the flight (RF01, TF92, etc.)
	Provide Preflight checklist and allow users to connect WIBS (single button?)
